# Firezone Ansible role

>[!WARNING]
> This role is configured to install the legacy 0.7 version of Firezone which has reached end-of-life status and stopped receiving updates since January 31st, 2024. For later versions, Firezone, Inc. does not provide support for self-hosting in production, while the source code remains provided for self-hosting Firezone for merely *educational* or *hobby* purposes. See [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20241230194456/https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/main/docs/README.md#can-i-self-host-firezone) for details.

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Firezone](https://www.firezone.dev/) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

This role *implicitly* depends on:

- [`com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help)
- [`com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base)

Check [`defaults/main.yml`](defaults/main.yml) for the full list of supported options. Refer to [this page](docs/configuring-firezone.md) for details about setting up the service with this role.

💡 For an Ansible playbook which integrates this role and makes it easier to use, see the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

## Development

You can optionally install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) so that simple mistakes are checked and noticed before changes are pushed to a remote branch. See [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) for which hooks are to be executed.

See [this section](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) on the official documentation for usage.
